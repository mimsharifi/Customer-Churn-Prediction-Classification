### Project Overview

This project predicts customer churn in a telecommunications company using machine learning, leveraging the Telco Customer Churn dataset. The goal is to identify customers at risk of leaving, enabling targeted retention strategies to reduce churn and save costs. The project features a sky blue-themed Jupyter notebook with custom-styled markdown cells and visualizations, including a tailored colormap for confusion matrices, ensuring a cohesive and professional presentation.



 ### Business Impact

The best model (Gradient Boosting) accurately identifies high-risk customers, enabling telecom companies to focus retention efforts (e.g., discounts, loyalty programs), reducing churn and saving on acquisition costs, which are 5-10 times higher than retention costs.
